Plugins 

	All of these bower + npm.
	Single repos.
	Can still have a single repo. But make a file for browser use.

	data-forge-from-yahoo
		fromYahoo
	
	data-forge-to-highstock
		toHighstockOHLC (expects X columns, datetime, then OHLC)
		toHighstock (expects two columns, datetime to be first column)
		
	data-forge-technical-analysis
		computeSMA (this is a column based function)
	
Issues

	Request promise is too big. There must be something simpler that will work in both node and browser? Maybe just 'request'.

Tidy up
	
	Should use data-forge to do the csv parsing!!
	
Article
		
	Need an example of how to run the code. eg. http-server
	Maybe mention that I use browserify to make the modules work in both node and the browser.
